Install the requirements file,

pip install -r requirements.txt

The Latex File folder you will find the Latex Code based project.

The Report itself.

And Python code folder for the code, one file is one is .py and other is .ipynb.

You can open the .ipynb file in the google colab, it will show you step by step.

Or you can just the python file in VS Code, or in terminal. 
However, if graph plots comes as pop up, view the graph plots then you can close it, and program resumes. 
This is only required if you are running the .py file. 

python bidirectional_associative_memory_bam.py -> run python program in terminal
or,
python3 bidirectional_associative_memory_bam.py
